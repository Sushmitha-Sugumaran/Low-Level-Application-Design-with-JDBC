# Low-Level-Application-Design-with-JDBC

This project focuses on designing a low-level application with direct JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) interaction, showcasing how to manage a relational database using Java. The project is built with the goal of demonstrating core JDBC principles, such as establishing database connections, executing SQL queries, and handling data efficiently.

## Key Features:
- Direct connection between Java and MySQL using JDBC.
- Implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Transaction management with commit and rollback functionality.
- Error handling for SQL exceptions.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Java**: Core programming language used to develop the application.
- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity for managing database operations.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system.

This project is ideal for those interested in learning how to build Java applications with direct database interactions, providing insight into JDBC's fundamentals and best practices.
